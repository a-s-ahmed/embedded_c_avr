This project is  the first "real" one.

Goal: Program an ATMmega2560 microcontroller to be the brains of an automatic door using an Ultrasonic distance sensor and writing to a servo (or LED) to simulate opening the door whenever someone is within the range. The purpose of this is to investigate interrupts.

Progress: mostly done, few errors. waiting on the hardware to arrive at my house for final testing.
