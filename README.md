# embedded_c_avr
Collection of embedded c projects for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (ATmega328P Found on the Arduino Uno) 

Testing dev on Atmel Visual Studio then porting to tinkerCAD so the results are able to be seen. Starting off with the basics today.

For now, to see results just follow instructions within the comments of the code. But in general, open a tinkerCAD circuit, set it up to look like the .png file, paste the code into the code tab and run!

TODOS: 
    finish setting up atmel visual studio so i can build my projects and have better code structure
    acquire an uno, or check to ensure the Mega i have will work
    Look into manual for ATmega328p more ideas, think of projects involving more IO, more i2c/SPI, GPBIO, and bluetooth connectivity with more complex structure.
